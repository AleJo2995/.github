## OSCAL Compass

----

OSCAL Compass is an ensemble of tools that enable the creation, validation, and governance of documentation artifacts for compliance needs. It leverages NIST's [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/) as a standard data format for interchange between tools and people, and provides an opinionated approach to OSCAL adoption.
